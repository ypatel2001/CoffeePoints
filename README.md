# CoffeePoints
A Java program that can calculate the amount of rewards points you have racked 
up at your local coffee shop based on a tiered level of cups that correspond to certain point-per-cup.

Uses the J option pane as a makeshift GUI for the user to make the program easier to use and more realistic. 
Formats points to a single decimal place from a floating point using string format. 
Also is logically based on switch cases with a nested if at the end to handle negative and equal-to edge cases. 

Feel free to use it as is or implement it into your own program and expand upon it! 
Enjoy!
